Online Blood Bank Management System
Project Overview
The Online Blood Bank Management System is a web-based platform that connects blood donors, recipients, and blood banks. It facilitates the search, availability, and management of blood donations, ensuring that users can quickly find nearby blood banks with the required blood type availability.

The system is designed to assist patients, hospitals, and emergency responders by providing real-time information about blood stock levels at different registered blood banks in a given city.

Features
User Features
✅ Search Blood Banks – Users can enter their city name to find all registered blood banks nearby.
✅ Check Blood Stock Availability – Users can view the available blood stock for different blood types at each blood bank.
✅ Contact Blood Banks – Users get contact details of each blood bank for further communication.
✅ Location-based Search – The system provides a list of blood banks based on proximity to the user.

Admin/Blood Bank Features
✅ Blood Bank Registration – Blood banks can register and manage their details.
✅ Update Blood Stock – Blood banks can update their stock availability in real time.
✅ Manage Requests – Blood banks can view and process blood donation and request applications.

Technologies Used
Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Angular (for UI components and routing)
Backend:
Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate (for API and business logic)
RESTful APIs (to interact with the frontend)
Database:
MySQL (to store user data, blood bank details, and blood stock levels)
Other Tools:
Postman (for API testing)
GitHub (for version control)
Role in the Project
As a Full Stack Developer, my key contributions were:

Developed the search functionality that allows users to find blood banks in their city.
Integrated backend APIs to fetch and display real-time blood stock data.
Implemented a responsive UI for better user experience.
Debugged and troubleshot errors, ensuring smooth application functionality.
Collaborated with the team to optimize database queries for fast search results.

How It Works?
1️⃣ User searches for a blood bank by entering the city name.
2️⃣ The system fetches and displays all blood banks registered in that city.
3️⃣ Users can view stock availability and choose the nearest blood bank.
4️⃣ Blood banks can update stock details to maintain real-time accuracy.
5️⃣ Users can contact the blood bank directly for urgent requests.

Future Enhancements
🔹 Google Maps API Integration – Display the exact location of blood banks on a map.
🔹 Donor Registration & Appointment System – Allow users to register as donors and schedule blood donations.
🔹 Automated Alerts & Notifications – Notify users when a required blood type is available nearby.
🔹 AI-based Predictive Analysis – Predict blood demand in different areas based on historical data.

Conclusion
The Online Blood Bank Management System is a life-saving platform that simplifies the process of finding and managing blood donations. By leveraging Java Spring MVC, MySQL, and Angular, we have developed an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly system. This project not only improved our technical skills but also contributed to a social cause, making it one of the most impactful projects we have worked on.
